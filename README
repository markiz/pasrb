PAS.rb -- the ruby window to PAS API
====================================

This gem is a client library for querying PAS API. 
API docs can be found here: http://www.pokeraffiliatesolutions.com/docs/

Installation
============

* `gem install pasrb`
* `require pas`
* 
    pas_api = PAS.new('YOUR_API_ACCESS_KEY', 'YOUR_API_ACCESS_TOKEN')
    pas_api.list_all_members # { "SAMPLEUSER" => {:id => 28746, :login => "SAMPLEUSER", ...}, "WTFOMG" => {:id => 28123, :login => "WTFOMG", ...} }
    
    
Problems
========

Most methods are safeguarded with rescues. If you have problems struggling with them, or you need explicit error messages, let me know, I'll set up some
anti-safeguards. 


Important notes
===============

That is some minimal subset of PAS API functions (I, for one, don't need most of them), 
if you'd like to modify / add functionality, feel free to fork + pull request.

That is a working draft, although I could make use of it, hope it's helpful for ya.
